# Google-Managed SSL Certificate Migration
**Status: IN PROGRESS - Certificate Provisioning**
**Started:** October 22, 2025 at 20:24 IST
**Production Impact:** ‚úÖ ZERO (Production using old certificate)

---

## üéØ Current Status

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Certificate Creation (COMPLETED)
```
Started:  20:24 IST
Finished: 20:24 IST
Duration: 30 seconds
Impact:   ZERO

Result: Google-managed certificate "qualitest-managed" created successfully
Status: PROVISIONING (Google validating domain ownership)
```

### üîÑ Phase 2: Certificate Provisioning (IN PROGRESS)
```
Started:     20:24 IST
Expected:    15-60 minutes
Current:     PROVISIONING
Impact:      ZERO

Google is validating domain ownership and issuing certificate.
This is automatic - no action required.

Monitor: tail -f /tmp/ssl_provisioning.log
```

### ‚è≥ Phase 3: Switch to New Certificate (PENDING)
```
Status:  Waiting for certificate to become ACTIVE
Action:  Will update HTTPS proxy to use new certificate
Impact:  Minimal (1-2 minute SSL renegotiation)
Timing:  Only after certificate is ACTIVE
```

### ‚è≥ Phase 4: Verification (PENDING)
```
Status:  Not started
Action:  Test all production URLs
Impact:  ZERO (read-only verification)
```

### ‚è≥ Phase 5: Cleanup (PENDING)
```
Status:   Not started
Action:   Keep old certificate for 24 hours, then delete
Impact:   ZERO
Timing:   24 hours after successful verification
```

## üîí Production Protection Status

### Current Production State:
```
Active Certificate:       qualitest-letsencrypt (Let's Encrypt)
Load Balancer:           Using old certificate
Production URLs:         ‚úÖ ALL WORKING
User Impact:             ‚úÖ NONE

URLs Verified:
  ‚úÖ https://qualitest.info/smartstakeholdersearch
  ‚úÖ https://qualitest.info/defense-site
  ‚úÖ https://qualitest.info/
```

### Certificates Status:
```
OLD (Active):
  Name:         qualitest-letsencrypt
  Type:         SELF_MANAGED (Let's Encrypt)
  Status:       ACTIVE on Load Balancer ‚úÖ
  Expires:      January 6, 2026
  Serving:      100% of production traffic

NEW (Provisioning):
  Name:         qualitest-managed
  Type:         MANAGED (Google)
  Status:       PROVISIONING (not active yet)
  Expires:      Will auto-renew every 90 days
  Serving:      0% of traffic (not connected yet)
```

## üìä Timeline

### Actual Timeline:
```
20:24 IST - ‚úÖ Certificate creation started
20:24 IST - ‚úÖ Certificate created (PROVISIONING state)
20:24 IST - ‚úÖ Production verified working
20:27 IST - üîÑ Monitoring started
20:xx IST - ‚è≥ Waiting for ACTIVE status...

Expected completion: 20:40 - 21:25 IST (15-60 minutes)
```

### Estimated Remaining Time:
```
Certificate Provisioning: 15-60 minutes (typically 20-30 minutes)
Certificate Switch:       2-3 minutes
Verification:            2-3 minutes
Total Remaining:         20-65 minutes
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Measures in Place

### Zero-Downtime Strategy:
1. ‚úÖ Old certificate remains active during provisioning
2. ‚úÖ New certificate not connected until fully ACTIVE
3. ‚úÖ Load Balancer continues using old certificate
4. ‚úÖ Production traffic unaffected
5. ‚úÖ Instant rollback possible if needed

### Rollback Plan:
```bash
# If anything goes wrong, instant rollback:
gcloud compute target-https-proxies update qualitest-https-proxy \
  --ssl-certificates=qualitest-letsencrypt \
  --global \
  --project=smartstakeholdersearch

# Rollback time: 30-60 seconds
# Production restored: Immediately
```

---

## üìù Next Steps (Automatic)

### When Certificate Becomes ACTIVE:

**Step 1: Verify Certificate Ready**
```bash
gcloud compute ssl-certificates describe qualitest-managed \
  --global --format="value(managed.status)"
# Expected output: ACTIVE
```

**Step 2: Update HTTPS Proxy (1-2 min impact)**
```bash
gcloud compute target-https-proxies update qualitest-https-proxy \
  --ssl-certificates=qualitest-managed \
  --global \
  --project=smartstakeholdersearch
```

**Step 3: Verify Production Working**
```bash
# Test all URLs:
curl -I https://qualitest.info/smartstakeholdersearch/
curl -I https://qualitest.info/defense-site/
curl -I https://qualitest.info/

# Check certificate:
echo | openssl s_client -servername qualitest.info -connect qualitest.info:443 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -issuer -dates
```

**Step 4: Keep Old Cert as Backup**
```bash
# Wait 24 hours to ensure stability
# Delete after confirmation:
gcloud compute ssl-certificates delete qualitest-letsencrypt \
  --global \
  --project=smartstakeholdersearch
```

## üö® What to Watch For

### Normal Behavior:
- ‚úÖ Certificate status: PROVISIONING for 15-60 minutes
- ‚úÖ Production continues working normally
- ‚úÖ No errors in logs
- ‚úÖ Users experience no issues

### Warning Signs (NONE expected):
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Certificate status changes to FAILED
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Provisioning takes longer than 2 hours
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Production URLs become inaccessible

**Current Status: All normal ‚úÖ**

## üìû Monitoring Commands

### Check Certificate Status:
```bash
gcloud compute ssl-certificates describe qualitest-managed \
  --global --project=smartstakeholdersearch \
  --format="value(managed.status,managed.domainStatus)"
```

### Watch Live Progress:
```bash
tail -f /tmp/ssl_provisioning.log
```

### Verify Production:
```bash
curl -I https://qualitest.info/smartstakeholdersearch/
```

### Check Active Certificate:
```bash
gcloud compute target-https-proxies describe qualitest-https-proxy \
  --global --format="value(sslCertificates[0])"
```

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

Migration will be considered successful when:
1. ‚úÖ New certificate status = ACTIVE
2. ‚úÖ HTTPS proxy updated to new certificate
3. ‚úÖ All production URLs responding correctly
4. ‚úÖ Certificate issuer = Google Trust Services
5. ‚úÖ Auto-renewal confirmed working
6. ‚úÖ Zero user-reported issues

## üìà Benefits After Migration

### Before (Current - Let's Encrypt):
```
Renewal:       Manual every 90 days
Time Cost:     30 minutes per renewal
Annual Cost:   2 hours maintenance
Risk:          Missed renewal = outage
Tools:         Certbot required
```

### After (Google-Managed):
```
Renewal:       Automatic every 90 days
Time Cost:     0 minutes (fully automatic)
Annual Cost:   0 hours maintenance
Risk:          None (Google handles it)
Tools:         None required
```

**Time Saved:** 2 hours/year
**Risk Reduced:** 100% (no missed renewals)
**Cost:** $0 (still free!)
