# ‚úÖ Firebase Cleanup Complete

## What Was Removed (Safe - No Impact on Production)

### 1. ‚úÖ Firebase Preview Channel
- **Deleted:** `preview` channel
- **URL removed:** https://smartstakeholdersearch--preview-xun6spsl.web.app
- **Impact:** None - this was only for testing

### 2. ‚úÖ Local Firebase Files
- **Deleted:** `/Users/sism/Downloads/firebase-migration/` directory
- **Contents removed:**
  - firebase.json (routing config)
  - .firebaserc (project config)
  - MIGRATION_STEPS.md (documentation)
  - public/ directory (defense site files)
- **Impact:** None - these were local files only

### 3. ‚è≥ DNS Record (Manual Action Required)
**YOU NEED TO DO THIS:**
1. Go to: https://dcc.godaddy.com/manage/qualitest.info/dns
2. Find CNAME record:
   - Host: `test`
   - Points to: `smartstakeholdersearch.web.app`
3. **Delete it**

**After deletion:**
- ‚ùå https://test.qualitest.info will stop working (intended)
- ‚úÖ https://qualitest.info continues working (production unaffected)

---

## What Remains (Safe to Keep - Free)

### Firebase Hosting Site
**Status:** Still exists in GCP project
**URL:** https://smartstakeholdersearch.web.app
**Cost:** $0/month (free tier)
**Files:** Defense site still hosted there
**Impact on production:** NONE

**Why it's safe:**
- Firebase Hosting is FREE (you're using <1GB)
- It's not serving your production traffic
- Your production uses: Load Balancer ‚Üí Cloud Run
- No charges for keeping it

**If you want to delete it anyway:**
```bash
# Optional - only if you really want to remove it
gcloud services disable firebasehosting.googleapis.com --project=smartstakeholdersearch
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING:** This might affect Firebase-integrated features in your GCP project. Not recommended unless necessary.
